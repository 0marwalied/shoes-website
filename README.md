# Shoes Website - My Progress in Web Development

This is my updated website project! I built it after learning more about **HTML** and **CSS**. It’s a more advanced and professional version of my first website, and it shows how much I’ve improved.

## About the Project
This website is for a fictional shoe brand called **Luxe Walkers**. It includes:
- A modern and clean design.
- A navigation bar with dropdown menus.
- Sections for products, testimonials, and latest news.
- A footer with links and a subscription form.
- Advanced CSS animations and hover effects.

## What I’ve Learned Since My First Website
- How to use **advanced CSS** (like animations, transitions, and hover effects).
- How to create dropdown menus and interactive elements.
- How to structure a website with multiple sections.
- How to organize my code better for larger projects.

## What I’m Still Learning
- **Media Queries**: I’m currently learning how to make the website fully responsive (so it looks good on phones, tablets, and computers).

## How to View the Website
1. Visit the live website: [Shoes Website](https://0marwalied.github.io/shoes-website/)
2. Or, download the project files and open the `index.html` file in your browser.
